Windows service controller for node. Wraps [sc](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490995.aspx).

## Install

```bash
$ npm install windows-service-controller --save
```

## Usage

All commands return a promise. Information returned by the `sc` command, if any, will be parsed and passed when the promise is resolved. The error message from `sc` is also parsed and passed when the promise is rejected. Unless otherwise indicated, the promise is resolved when `sc` exits.

```js
var sc = require('windows-service-controller');

sc.getDisplayName('SomeService')
    .catch(function(error) { 
        console.log(error.message);
    })
    .done(function(displayName) { 
        console.log('Display name: ' + displayName); 
    });
```

The server name is optional for all commands. Omitting it will target the local machine. You do not need to specify the UNC path prefix as this is added automatically when a server name is passed. Either of the following are valid:

```js
sc.start('MyService');

sc.start('MyServer', 'MyService');
```

## Commands

All `sc` commands are fully supported by this module.

## Control Commands

Unlike the rest of the commands, `start`, `pause`, `continue` and `stop` do not resolve until the service state has changed or the timeout has been reached.

### Timeout

Sets the timeout for all control commands. Default is 30 seconds.

```js
sc.timeout(120);
```

### Poll Interval

Sets the poll interval for checking the state of the service. Default is 1 second.

```js
sc.pollInterval(5);
```

### Start

Starts a service or services. Resolves the promise when the *all* the services specified are running or rejects it if it timed out. *Server name and service arguments are optional.*

```js
sc.start('ServerName', 'ServiceName', {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30,

        // Arguments to pass into the service.
        args: ['ServiceArg1', 'ServiceArg2']
    });


sc.start('ServerName', ['ServiceName1', 'ServiceName2'], {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30,

        // Starts services serially. By default services are started in parallel.
        serial: true|false,

        // Arguments to pass into the services.
        args: ['ServiceArg1', 'ServiceArg2']
    });
```

### Pause

Sends a PAUSE control request to a service or services. Resolves the promise when *all* the services specified are paused or rejects it if it timed out. *Server name is optional.*

```js
sc.pause('ServerName', 'ServiceName', {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30
});

sc.pause('ServerName', ['ServiceName1', 'ServiceName2'], {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30,

        // Pauses services serially. By default services are paused in parallel.
        serial: true|false
    });
```

### Continue

Sends a CONTINUE control request to a service or services in order to resume a paused service. Resolves the promise when *all* the services specified are running or rejects it if it timed out. *Server name is optional.*

```js
sc.continue('ServerName', 'ServiceName', {
    
        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30
});

sc.continue('ServerName', ['ServiceName1', 'ServiceName2'], {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30,
        
        // Starts services serially. By default services are started in parallel.
        serial: true|false
    });
```

### Stop

Sends a STOP control request to a service or services. Resolves the promise when *all* the services specified are stopped or rejects it if it timed out.  *Server name and flags are optional.*

*Note:* By default this method waits for the service(s) to be in a stopped state. Even though a service is in a stopped state, the service process itself can still be running. This can happen if it takes some time for the service process to terminate after all it's services have been stopped or if the service process hosts other services that are in a running state. To wait for the service process to terminate, instead of waiting for the service(s) to stop, use the `waitForExit` flag below.

```js
sc.stop('ServerName', 'ServiceName', {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30,

        // Waits for the service process to terminate instead of waiting for the 
        // service(s) to indicate they've stopped. All services hosted by the 
        // service process must be stopped for the process to terminate.
        // This is useful when you need to work with files that are locked
        // by the service process.
        waitForExit: true|false
    });

sc.stop('ServerName', ['ServiceName1', 'ServiceName2'], {

        // Sets the timeout for this command. Default is 30 seconds.
        // Overrides the global timeout.
        timeout: 30,

        // Stops services serially. By default services are stopped in parallel.
        serial: true|false,

        // Waits for the service process to terminate instead of waiting for the 
        // service(s) to indicate they've stopped. All services hosted by the 
        // service process must be stopped for the process to terminate.
        // This is useful when you need to work with files that are locked
        // by the service process.
        waitForExit: true|false
    });
```

### Control

Sends a CONTROL B to a service. *Server name is optional.*

```js
sc.control('ServerName', 'ServiceName', 
    'paramchange|netbindadd|netbindremove|netbindenable|netbinddisable|UserDefinedControlB');
```

### Interrogate

Sends an INTERROGATE control request to a service. *Server name is optional.*

```js
sc.interrogate('ServerName', 'ServiceName');
```
